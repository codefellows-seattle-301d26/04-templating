# Project Name
**Authors**: Jordan Lesaca, Steven Carpenter
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This blog is for users that want to view various articles that can be filtered
by author or category. All the content on the page is produced from
precaptured raw article data.

## Getting Started
To build the app, you'll have to clone the repo into your directory in an area
of your choosing and then you'll need to open index.html in the browser or run
live-server to view the blog.

## Architecture
The blog makes extensive use of the jQuery library for traversing the DOM,
reading information from the DOM, and updating the DOM. The blog also uses the
Handlebars Templating library to simply the updating process used to append
articles to the DOM. In this iteration of the blog, it utilizes arrow
functions where possible to reduce the amount of characters.
