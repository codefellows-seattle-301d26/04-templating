## Overview

Using handlebars to clone template so we can create it dynamically and render the articles to html in easy way.

## Getting Started
 Users need to edit html page ;
     Editing in html:
     1- add <div id = "place-holder"></div>
     2- add old template inside head and add the constructor property inside handlebar tag
User need to edit  article.js file.Edit Article.prototype to get needed information and render it.
Then user need to convert functions to arrow function inside the articleView.js
## Architecture

2-JQUERY
