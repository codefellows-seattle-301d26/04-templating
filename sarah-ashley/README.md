**Author**: Sarah and Ashley
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We're building a blog with sortable articles.

## Getting Started
The user must be able to read through the lab documentation.  If they want to change the blog posts, they will need to edit the objects in blogArticles.js

## Architecture
We used jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML and the Handlebars library to create this app.

## Change Log


12-08-2017 11:18pm - Application now has a fully-functional handebars template to render the article objects to the page.  Functions in articleView.js have been updated to ECS6 best practices using arrow functions.

## Credits and Collaborations
We want to thank the invaluable help of our classmates, TA and Instructor.
